Currently active long term project, a collaboration between Google and the research group [Crowther Lab](https://www.crowtherlab.com/), developing an open data platform for ecosystem restoration.
The platform is scheduled to go public later this year.

We have in the creative lab been leading the development of the platform in close collaboration with Crowther Lab that long term will run and grow the platform. The TED talk above gives a sneak peak into the platform.
