[Picture.studio](https://picture.studio) is a tool created for designed and creatives meant to let them utilize the new capabilities AI provides for image creation and editing. 

As a founding member and the company's first CTO, I led the technical work in its first year and a half. This involved all the early stage decisions and work 
of building the application, from the initial MVP to the first public release. This involved both building out infrastructure on Kubernetes for image inference and model training, as well
as all the api and frontend work to make the application usable, as well as setting up a team of developers to push the project forward.
