Worked with the creative team doing the opening and closing stage shows for the Eurovision Song Contest when it was hosted in Copenhagen in 2014. I was helping the team brainstorm on interactive graphics and worked on an idea for tracking boxes on the stage and adding a live video of dancers inside them.

I was set with the task of creating the system for this and made an openFrameworks app doing live 3D tracking of markers placed on the boxes, directly from the broadcast feed. The app outputted broadcast video with the virtual boxes rendered on top.

I collaborated with [Vertigo](http://vertigo.dk/) on creating the hardware setup handling the live tracking and broadcast input/output.
