[Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com) is a A.I. Experiment created as a collaboration between Google Creative Lab, danish duo [St√∏j](http://stoj.io) and the PAIR group at Google that has created [deeplearn.js](https://github.com/PAIR-code/deeplearnjs). 

The experiment is exciting, because it's the first time we really have been exploring running and training machine learning models right in a browser in a way that everyone can use it. Read more about the project on the [site](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com).
