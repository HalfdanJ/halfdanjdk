Worked as a lead developer on an installation for Adidas with London based creative studio [Hellicar&Lewis](http://www.hellicarandlewis.com/). The installation was for the release of a new Adidas shoe that allowed custom prints. 

My task was to create software for doing projection mapping on a white Adidas shoe using two projectors, and allow the audience to tweet an image to us that we then projected on the shoe, and returned a picture showing how the shoe would look like with their photo printed on it. 

The installation was shown both in their Berlin and London shop. The installation was primarily build in openFrameworks and node.js.
