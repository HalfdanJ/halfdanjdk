Worked as a lead developer on an installation for Adidas with London based creative studio [Hellicar&Lewis](http://www.hellicarandlewis.com/). The installation was for the release of a new Adidas shoe that allowed custom prints. 

Our task was to do projection mapping on a white Adidas shoe using two projectors, and allow people on twitter to tweet a image, project it on the shoe, and send a picture back showing how the shoe would look like with their photo printed on it. 

The installation was shown both in their Berlin and London shop. The installation was primarily build in openFrameworks and node.js.
