[Quick, Draw!](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com) is a game released as one of the [A.I Experiments](https://aiexperiments.withgoogle.com) launched by Google Creative Lab. 

I came up with the idea for the game during an internal hackathon, and with huge help from collegues at Google handwriting recognition team, we were able to launch it to the public using the same algorithms that powering the handwriting recognition on [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/) and many other products. We trained a custom classifier for the game, using data we collected, and by playing the game, players have improved the classifier.

The hope with the game was to give people a game that allows them to interact with machine learning in a fun and delightfull way.

The game went at launch viral, and was for a brief moment #1 on reddit, and got on Fox News...
