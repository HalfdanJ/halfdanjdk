[Quick, Draw!](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com) is a game released as one of the [A.I Experiments](https://aiexperiments.withgoogle.com) launched by Google Creative Lab. 

I came up with the idea for the game during an internal hackathon, and with huge help from the handwriting recognition team at google, we were able to launch it to the public using the same algorithms that are used for handwriting recognition on [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/). The games allows players to have a fun interaction with machine learning, and learn a bit about how machines recognizes drawings. 

The game went at launch viral, and was for a brief moment #1 on reddit, and got on Fox News...
