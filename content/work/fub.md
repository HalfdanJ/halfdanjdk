Together with [Recoil Performance Group](recoil-performance.org) (choreographer Tina Tarpgaard and programmer Ole Kristensen), I created this dance performance at Dansescenen. Like [Frost](/work/frost) we developed our own software that was tracking the 4 dancers live on stage, and generating video projected on the floor and screens from 2 projectors.

The show premiered at Dansescenen in Copenhagen, and has been shown in Firenze 2010 and Stockholm 2010.
