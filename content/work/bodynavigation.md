First collaboration with choreographer Tina Tarpgaard and programmer [Ole Kristensen](http://ole.kristensen.name/) under the name [Recoil Performance Group](http://recoil-performance.org) on an interactive dance performance. We were invited to create one of the rooms in a large dance performance called *Labyrinth* by [Danish Dance Theatre](http://www.danskdanseteater.dk/?language=en). We developed a set of scenes in Processing that created live graphics projected on the floor around the two dancers, and software tracking the dancers using an infrared camera mounted in the ceiling. 

The collaboration in this piece sparked a many year long collaboration between the three of us, creating new performances that worked around the same idea of interactive graphics. And with the first performance we learned a lot about scaling up code to run on a theatre stage, and make it easy to tour with around the world. 

A video of a very early test of the reactive strings in the performance:
