First collaboration with choreographer Tina Tarpgaard and programmer [Ole Kristensen]() under the name [Recoil Performance Group](recoil-performance.org) on a interactive dance performance. We were invited to create one of the rooms in a large dance performance called *Labyrinth* by [Danish Dance Theatre](). We developed a set of scenes in Processing that created live graphics projected on the floor around the two dancers, and software tracking the dancers using a infrared camera mounted in the ceiling. 

The collaboration in this piece sparked a many year long collaboration between the three of us, creating new performances that worked around the same idea of interactive graphics. And this first performance teached us a lot about scaling up code to run on a theatre stage, and make it easy to tour with around the world.
