A small experimental installation made during my 3 month stay at [School for Poetic Computation](http://sfpc.io/). The installation sniffs all the network packages on the local network for image urls, downloads and shows them on a screen with a distortion shader.

The installation was developed in openFrameworks, and for the installation I created a new addon for doing the network sniffing called [ofxSniffer](https://github.com/HalfdanJ/ofxSniffer).
