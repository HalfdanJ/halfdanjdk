Worked with the creative team doing the opening and closing stage shows for the Eurovision Song Contest when it was hosted in Copenhagen in 2014. I was helping the team brainstorm on interactive graphics, and worked on an idea for tracking boxes on the stage, and adding live video of dancers inside them. 

I was set the task of creating the system for this, and made a openFrameworks app doing live 3D tracking of markers placed on the boxes, directly from the broadcast feed. The app outputted broadcast video with the virtual boxes rendered on-top. 

I collaborated with [Vertigo](http://vertigo.dk/) on creating the hardware setup handling the live tracking and broadcast input/output.
