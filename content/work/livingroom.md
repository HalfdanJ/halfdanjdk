Living Room is the result of a process in [Recoil Performance Group](http://recoil-performance.org/) where we wanted to step back a little bit and look at what we did at [Frost](/work/frost). The setup has many similarities, but it’s still a very different performance as a result of the years of work in-between. It’s a performance of an hour with 3 dancers on stage, and a video scenography that is evolving during the whole performance with help from the interaction of the dancers. Most of the video scenography is made of a polygon world that in the beginning of the performance is being generated, and slowly during the performance is being crumbled and manipulated by the dancers, transitioning from a static cold world into a mysterious dynamic world where the dancers are connected with the dynamic set design. My role was designing and implementing the video scenography and tracking.

The performance won the [Reumert](http://www.aaretsreumert.dk/reumert-prisregn-over-scenekunsten) (the biggest theatre prize in Denmark) for best dance performance of the year. The performance went on tour in spring 2014 in Denmark.
