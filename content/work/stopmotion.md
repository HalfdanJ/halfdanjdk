An interactive photo installation created for a 4,5 x 8 meter LED monolith. Combining infrared tracking of a normal light bulb and still images, indexing photos of audience holding the light bulb in different positions. When participating audience moves the bulb within the image, the large screen scrubs through previous images of other people having had the bulb at the same position. When someone moves the bulb to an uninhabited spot with no previous photos, it store the photo in the database.

Ole Kristensen and I sketched up the installation in a few days for re:new 2008, on a very short notice. First iteration was done in processing, but with many memory issues. Despite that it ended up having a playful and informal presence in the Copenhagen Main Square.

We have since then been invited to New Media Meeting 03, where we decided to port the software into openFrameworks.
