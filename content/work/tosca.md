[Vision4](http://vision4.dk/) was asked by [Opera på Skäret](http://www.operapaskaret.se/) to do the visual work for the classic opera Tosca, and i was hired to do the video programming and assisting on creating the visual material. Opera på Skäret is a old big sawmill in the middle of nowhere that now is used by a private opera company that makes one to two plays each year, getting people from far away with special train to see it.

We builded 3 small eyeliners in this beautiful room hanging in long wires from the roof, and created virtual walls in the room. A mac pro running isadora was the core of the system creating the 3 projections, and in one scene i had Eyesweb running to track the opera singer and make blood float out of the body reacting on the movement of the singer. It was accomplished with a custom programmed adon for isadora i did myself. The material was otherwise primary prerendered video made by Arthur Steijn and me, and a couple of times live cams places around on the stage.
