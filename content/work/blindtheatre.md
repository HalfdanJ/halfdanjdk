Art project by [Ståle Stenslie](http://www.stenslie.net/) on the National Theatre in Oslo as midnight performance where the audience where suited up in custom made suits with 64 vibrators, blind-folded and heard music/texts composed for the performance. I produced in collaboration with Ståle the suits in Oslo during the summer where we had to create a custom software to design the timelines for vibrations that could be played back on a small computer on the audiences back.
