Worked over a long period from 2013 on a large project at the [Danish Broadcast - DR](http://dr.dk) on creating a new system for handling all video clips in between the programs, also known as the Airlook. 

The task was to come up with a system where the advanced ideas the DR Design department had for the new designs on the 6 TV channels could work in an automated broadcast world. It turned out that no broadcast systems could handle it, so we had to create it from bottom up. 

Together with [Johan Bichel](http://johan.cc) and Martin Bollerup, we created a new system using our own render farm of After Effects that automatically rendered out all the video clips. 

Here are a couple of the airlooks we implemented.

DR K (culture)

DR Ultra (for older children)

We also created a site where marketing could specify all the variables, and get them rendered automatically.
