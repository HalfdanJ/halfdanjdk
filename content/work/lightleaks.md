A scattered array of fifty mirror balls reflect light from three projectors, filling a room completely with small reflections, casting patterns that fill the visitor’s peripheral vision. Creating a curious space that alternates between a meditative state, and an uneasy imbalance. An experiment in combining a found object with computer vision to create a profound and unusual experience. Installation created in collaboration with [Kyle McDonald](http://kylemcdonald.net/) for [Click Festival 2013](http://clickfestival.dk/)

Installation has been shown at [La Gaîté Lyrique](https://gaite-lyrique.net/en/capitaine-futur-and-the-extraordinary-journey) (Paris, 2014) and [Scopitone Festival](http://www.stereolux.org/scopitone-2016) (Nantes, 2015)
